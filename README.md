# MULIMEDIA_APPLICATION

The upload and search functionalities in detail:

**Upload Functionality:**
- The `handleFileUpload` function is triggered when the user selects files using the file input field.
- It receives the `event` object containing the selected files.
- It creates an empty array called `uploadedFiles` to store the file information.
- It iterates over each selected file using a `for` loop.
- Inside the loop, it creates a new object `newFile` containing the file information such as `id`, `name`, `type`, and `path`.
   - `id`: A unique identifier generated by combining the current timestamp with the loop index.
   - `name`: The name of the file extracted from the `file.name` property.
   - `type`: The type of the file determined by the `getFileType` function based on the file's MIME type.
   - `path`: A URL created using the `URL.createObjectURL` method, which generates a temporary URL for the file.
- The `newFile` object is then added to the `uploadedFiles` array.
- After the loop, the Apologies for the confusion. Here's the updated explanation of the functionalities in your multimedia app, including the upload success modal:

**Upload Functionality:**

   - `type`: The type of the file determined by the `getFileType` function based on the file's MIME type.
   - `path`: A URL created using the `URL.createObjectURL` method, which generates a temporary URL for the file.
- The `newFile` object is then added to the `uploadedFiles` array.
- After the loop, the file list is updated by appending the `uploadedFiles` array to the existing `myFiles` array using the spread operator (`...`).
- The `uploadedFiles` state is also updated by appending the `uploadedFiles` array to the existing `uploadedFiles` state.
   - This step is necessary to keep track of uploaded files separately from the initial `myFiles` state.
- The `setShowUploadSuccessModal` function is called to set the `showUploadSuccessModal` state to `true`, triggering the display of the upload success modal.
- Finally, the `uploadingFile` state is set to `false`, indicating that the uploading process is complete.

**Upload Success Modal:**
- The upload success modal is implemented as a separate component, which can be rendered conditionally based on the `showUploadSuccessModal` state.
- When the `showUploadSuccessModal` state is `true`, the modal component is rendered, displaying the "Upload Successful" message.
- The modal component can be closed by clicking on a close button or using any other desired method.

**Search Functionality:**
- The search functionality is divided into two parts: keyword-based search and file type filter.
- The search keyword and file type filter are stored in the `searchKeyword` and `searchFileType` states, respectively.
- Whenever the `searchKeyword`, `searchFileType`, `myFiles`, or `uploadedFiles` state changes, the `useEffect` hook is triggered.
- Inside the `useEffect` hook, a new array `allFiles` is created by combining the `myFiles` and `uploadedFiles` arrays.
- The `allFiles` array is filtered based on the following conditions:
   - The `matchesKeyword` variable is set to `true` if the file's name or type includes the search keyword (case-insensitive comparison).
   - If the selected file type is "all," the file is included in the filtered array.
   - If the selected file type is specific (e.g., "audio," "video," etc.), the file is included only if it matches the keyword and has the selected file type.
- The filtered array is then stored in the `filteredFiles` state.
- The `filteredFiles` array is rendered in the search modal, displaying the matching files.
- The search input field allows the user to enter a search keyword.
- The file type filter is implemented using a select dropdown, allowing the user to choose from different file types.
- Whenever the user changes the search keyword or file type filter, the corresponding states (`

searchKeyword` or `searchFileType`) are updated accordingly.
- The `filteredFiles` array is then updated based on the new search conditions, triggering a re-render of the search modal with the updated file list.

That's a detailed explanation of the upload, upload success modal, and search functionalities in the given code. Let me know if you need any further clarification!
