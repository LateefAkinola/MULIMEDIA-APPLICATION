The upload and search functionalities in detail:

**Upload Functionality:**
1. The `handleFileUpload` function is triggered when the user selects files using the file input field.
2. It receives the `event` object containing the selected files.
3. It creates an empty array called `uploadedFiles` to store the file information.
4. It iterates over each selected file using a `for` loop.
5. Inside the loop, it creates a new object `newFile` containing the file information such as `id`, `name`, `type`, and `path`.
   - `id`: A unique identifier generated by combining the current timestamp with the loop index.
   - `name`: The name of the file extracted from the `file.name` property.
   - `type`: The type of the file determined by the `getFileType` function based on the file's MIME type.
   - `path`: A URL created using the `URL.createObjectURL` method, which generates a temporary URL for the file.
6. The `newFile` object is then added to the `uploadedFiles` array.
7. After the loop, the file list is updated by appending the `uploadedFiles` array to the existing `myFiles` array using the spread operator (`...`).
8. The `uploadedFiles` state is also updated by appending the `uploadedFiles` array to the existing `uploadedFiles` state.
   - This step is necessary to keep track of uploaded files separately from the initial `myFiles` state.
9. Finally, the `uploadingFile` state is set to `false`, indicating that the uploading process is complete.

**Search Functionality:**
1. The search functionality is divided into two parts: keyword-based search and file type filter.
2. The search keyword and file type filter are stored in the `searchKeyword` and `searchFileType` states, respectively.
3. Whenever the `searchKeyword`, `searchFileType`, `myFiles`, or `uploadedFiles` state changes, the `useEffect` hook is triggered.
4. Inside the `useEffect` hook, a new array `allFiles` is created by combining the `myFiles` and `uploadedFiles` arrays.
5. The `allFiles` array is filtered based on the following conditions:
   - The `matchesKeyword` variable is set to `true` if the file's name or type includes the search keyword (case-insensitive comparison).
   - If the selected file type is "all," the file is included in the filtered array.
   - If the selected file type is specific (e.g., "audio," "video," etc.), the file is included only if it matches the keyword and has the selected file type.
6. The filtered array is then stored in the `filteredFiles` state.
7. The `filteredFiles` array is rendered in the search modal, displaying the matching files.
8. The search input field allows the user to enter a search keyword.
9. The file type filter is implemented using a select dropdown, allowing the user to choose from different file types.
10. Whenever the user changes the search keyword or file type filter, the corresponding states (`searchKeyword` or `searchFileType`) are updated accordingly.
11. The `filteredFiles` array is then updated based on the new search conditions, triggering a re-render of the search modal with the updated file list.
